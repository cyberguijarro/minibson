# minibson

Zero-dependency C++ BSON libraries.

## Features

 * C++17 compliant
 * Two flavours tailored for perfomance and footprint
 * Supports double, string, document, binary, boolean, null, 32-bit integer and 64-bit integer types
 * Header-only files (this may change soon)
 * Supports serialization you own types in bson types by type_traits system 

## minibson

minibson is a DOM-style BSON implementation allowing create, update and delete
operations at any level of the document. Internally, it uses a node tree where
each node is dinamically allocated. Deserialization builds a new tree from the
input datastream, and serialization compresses the tree into a datastream.

## microbson

microbson is a much more efficient implementation, where no additional memory is
used to keep track of document nodes. All fields are directly read from
the datastream, which is traversed during each query. No insertions, modifications
or deletions are yet supported.

## Which one should I use?

 * If your code creates or updates documents, you'll have to stick with minibson
 * If all you want is to query documents (read-only), microbson is probably your
 best choice. The only exception might be very large documents with lots of keys
 in each level (microbson lookups are linear, while minibson indexes allow lookups
 in logarithmic times)
